An automatic JavaScript serialization/deserialization system for Firestore

**Update April 2022**: `firestore-serializers` now works with Firebase v9 and the new tree-shaking optimised API.

## Features
- Simple to use â€“ just pass a string to deserialize, or a DocumentSnapshot to serialize

- Also supports QuerySnapshot serialization and deserialization

- Can serialize/deserialize cyclical Firestore structured (i.e. DocumentReference) automatically

- Deep serialization/deserialization, including array members

- Works in-browser, in Node.js, or anywhere Firebase v9+ is supported

- Comes with full TypeScript type definitions

- Tested with high code coverage

## Why?
Firestore provides offline support, but it's fairly primitive: if your device doesn't have an internet connection, it uses the cached data, but otherwise it uses live data. So when you're on a slow connection, it often takes ages to query data.

A fix for this is to manually store Firestore data in your own caching system (e.g. React Native's AsyncStorage or LocalStorage in a browser). However, this often presents challenges because Firestore documents can contain non-serializable values.

This library does the heavy lifting for you, by converting special Firestore types (e.g. GeoPoint or DocumentReference) in your documents to serializable values, and vice-versa.

## Installation
```
npm install firestore-serializers
```

## Usage
```typescript
import {getDoc, doc, getDocs, collection, getFirestore} from 'firebase/firestore';
import {serializeDocumentSnapshot, serializeQuerySnapshot, deserializeDocumentSnapshot, deserializeDocumentSnapshotArray} from "firestore-serializers";

const firestore = getFirestore();

const myDoc = await getDoc(doc(firestore, 'my-collection', 'abc'));
const myCollection = await getDocs(collection(firestore, 'my-collection'));

// stringify document (returns string)
const serializedDoc = serializeDocumentSnapshot(myDoc);
 
// stringify query snapshot (returns string)
const serializedCollection = serializeQuerySnapshot(myCollection);

/**
 * Returns DocumentSnapshot-like object
 * This matches the actual DocumentSnapshot class in behaviour and properties,
 * but is NOT an instance of the DocumentSnapshot class.
 * 
 * You need to pass `firestore` just like with all other v9 Firebase functions.
 */
deserializeDocumentSnapshot(
    serializedDoc,
    firestore,
);

/**
 * Returns an array of DocumentSnapshot-like objects
 * Does NOT return a QuerySnapshot.
 * Think of it as returning the contents of the 'docs' property of a QuerySnapshot.
 */
deserializeDocumentSnapshotArray(
    serializedCollection,
    firestore,
);
```

## Limitations
Serialized documents use certain prefixes to denote when a property is a special Firestore type (GeoPoint, Timestamp, or DocumentReference). This means if you're genuinely storing one of the following string values and try to deserialize a document, `firestore-serializers` will try to decode it as a Firestore type:

- `__DocumentReference__`
- `__GeoPoint__`
- `__Timestamp__`

This could also open your code up to injection attacks, so make sure to sanitize user inputs! A backwards-compatible fix will be published soon.
